1. The specs of signup are not correct as removing the insert query will not fail the spec.
2. So create something which checks signup correctly
3. arrange User_spec with context in terms of "logged in" and "not logged in" User_spec
4. Cli needs to be cleaned as there are two delegators
5. if cannot remove two delegators express intent properly 
   (maybe with signup view and login view)
6. Not able to give apostrophy in the long tweet spec [ :Solution Use $ in query for arguments rather than string interpolation]
